      <h1>Gaming</h1>
      <p>
        I have been a gamer pretty much my entire life. I have always been drawn
        to games and often lose myself for hours whilst playing. As a
        PlayStation fanboy I have had every console and handheld since the
        PlayStation 2, playing titles from Battlefield to Elder Scrolls to FIFA.
        Playing online with my friends and family is a lot of fun and creates a
        lot of competition between people that I know. I have recently delved
        into the PC side of things and that in itself is a very different
        ballgame opposed to console gaming when it comes spec-ing your pc sand
        building.
