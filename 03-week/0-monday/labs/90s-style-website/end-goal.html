      <h1>Software Development</h1>
      <p>
        Despite the short time I have been a software developer, I have fallen
        in love with the art of writing code and continue to want to improve and
        become the best developer I can be. After starting university as a
        business major and realizing how much I hated it, I decided to try to
        find a career in the industry I loved the most, technology. My end goal
        is to work with A.I and machine learning, I know that day is still far
        away and requires a lot of practice and dedication but the journey to
        getting there so far has been amazing.
