      <h1>Horror</h1>
      <p>
        Horror films are my favorite category of film. There is just something
        about the way really good horror films are made that keep my interest
        peaked. Crafting scary situations without using cheap jump-scares takes
        a lot of talent and it's something I am able to appreciate. The good
        thing about horror films is that the bad ones can be entertaining as
        well. They provide a lot of laughter, so even if the movie itself is bad
        it can create an entertaining atmosphere as you critique how bad the
        movie is especially with family and friends.
