      <h1>Favorite Sport</h1>
      <p>
        Soccer has played an important role in my life ever since I began
        playing in Middle-School. When living in Angola I was constantly playing
        and watching games in my spare time. Playing for both my school and at
        club level I have always enjoyed the competitiveness of the sport and
        played as often as I could. I now play as an attacking forward for the
        University of Houston and continue to love the sport as I have for much
        of my life!
